Subject: Request for Approval to Remove Vulnerable Container Images from JFrog Repository

Dear Application Team,

We have identified several container images in our JFrog repository that contain high- and critical-severity vulnerabilities (see CVE-2025-1234, CVE-2025-2345, etc.) and are failing Twistlock security scans. Retaining these images in our artifact registry poses a significant risk to our production environment.

Details:

    The attached report (“Detailed_CVE_Report.pdf”) provides a breakdown of each affected image and associated CVEs.

    In-place remediation is not feasible for these images.

    Twistlock will continue to flag these images, preventing successful deployment pipelines.

Action Required:

    Review the attached vulnerability report.

    Provide written approval to delete the identified images from the JFrog repository.

    If retention is absolutely required for legacy systems, please specify which images must be exempted so we can implement appropriate isolation measures.

We kindly request your decision by close of business today to avoid delays in our next deployment cycle. Should you have any questions or require additional information, please contact me directly.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
